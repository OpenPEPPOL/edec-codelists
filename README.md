# Peppol eDEC Code Lists

This repository is the working area for the Peppol eDEC Code Lists.

The latest code lists are always published at https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/codelists/

Structure of this repository:
* Folder `work-in-progress` contains the eDEC internal work in progress. Code lists are maintained in Excel and converted to different output formats later
* Folder `publication` contains the sources for https://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/codelists/
* Folder `peppol-codelist-tools` contains some tools to convert the Excel code lists to different formats
* Folder `old` contains old code list releases that are not featured in the publication. This folder is just present for archiving purposes.

## Peppol Codelist Tools

This is an OpenPeppol internal repository that contains the tools for converting the code lists maintained as Excel into other formats such as Genericode (GC) or JSON.

The code is licensed under Apache 2.0 license.

The original code was donated by Philip Helger to OpenPeppol.
